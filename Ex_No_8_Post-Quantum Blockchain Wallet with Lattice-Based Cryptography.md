# Experiment 8: Post-Quantum Blockchain Wallet with Lattice-Based Cryptography

# Aim:

To create a quantum-resistant wallet using lattice-based cryptography instead of traditional ECDSA, ensuring that future quantum computers cannot break private keys.

# Algorithm:

Step 1: Understand Quantum Threat: ECDSA-based wallets are vulnerable to quantum attacks; lattice-based cryptography (e.g., NTRU, CRYSTALS-Kyber) is quantum-resistant.

Step 2: Register User: User registers with a quantum-safe public key hash.

Step 3: Store User Data: Store the hashed lattice-based public key and track user registration.

Step 4: Transaction Setup: For sending funds, users must be registered and have sufficient balance.

Step 5: Signature Validation: Users must provide a quantum-resistant signature (hashed public key) for transaction validation.

Step 6: Transaction Execution: After signature verification, update balances between the sender and recipient.

Step 7: Event Logging: Emit events to confirm user registration and successful transaction verification.

# Expected Output:

Users register using a post-quantum secure public key.


Transactions require a quantum-resistant signature for authentication.


If a traditional quantum-vulnerable hash is used, the transaction fails.


# High-Level Overview:

First quantum-safe Ethereum-compatible wallet prototype.


Uses lattice-based key hashes instead of ECDSA.


Demonstrates how Ethereum will transition to post-quantum security.


Inspired by NISTâ€™s post-quantum cryptography competition.
